# Differential Drive Robot for EKF SLAM and Outdoor Navigation ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This repository contains a complete solution for **building, simulating, and navigating a differential drive robot**. It covers several key robotics concepts, such as **EKF-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**, **outdoor navigation**, and practical designs using **SolidWorks files**. The project integrates both hardware and software components necessary to develop and test mobile robotics systems.

## Repository Contents

### 1. EKF Localization and SLAM Algorithms  
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Localization**:
  - A Python-based ROS node for **localizing a differential drive robot** using **odometry, LiDAR data, and landmarks**.
  - Includes **data association** and **uncertainty modeling** to handle sensor noise and maintain accurate pose estimation.
  - Supports visualization in **RViz** for:
    - Robot pose
    - Detected objects (cylinders)
    - Error ellipses for covariance visualization

- **EKF SLAM**:
  - Implements **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for mapping an environment and localizing the robot within it.
  - Uses **odometry, LiDAR, and landmarks** to incrementally build a map and track the robotâ€™s pose.

---

### 2. Outdoor Navigation for Differential Drive Robot  
- Path planning and control for **outdoor environments** using a **custom motion planning algorithm**.
- Employs **costmaps** for obstacle avoidance and ensures smooth path generation.
- Configured for **TurtleBot3** and customizable for other differential drive platforms.

---

### 3. Simulation Setup in Gazebo  
- Simulation environments containing landmarks, obstacles, and **outdoor scenarios**.
- **TurtleBot3 robot model** is configured to work with EKF-based localization and SLAM.
- Easily extensible to other **differential drive robots**.

---

### 4. SolidWorks CAD Models  
- CAD models of a **custom differential drive robot** in **SolidWorks**.
- Includes:
  - **Chassis design**
  - **Wheel configurations**
  - **Sensor mounts for LiDAR and cameras**  
- Models can be used to build the physical robot.

---

### 5. ROS Package Setup and Code  
- Includes **ROS nodes and launch files** to easily run the simulations and real-world navigation tasks.
- Topics used:
  - `/odom`: Odometry data from robot
  - `/scan`: LiDAR scans for SLAM and obstacle detection
  - `/cmd_vel`: Velocity commands for robot movement  
- **Launch files**:
  - Launch Gazebo simulations with pre-configured environments.
  - Start EKF SLAM and navigation nodes with a single command.
